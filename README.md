# Fix The Apple Tree TDD

__Skill Level:__ Beginner  

The `tree.rb` script is incomplete. The script should model an apple tree that grows over the years. We should create/plant it, wait for it to bear fruit, pick the fruit and then eventually the tree should die. 

## Instructions
- Run your tests and fix the issues that surface  
- Before you begin working on a method, think about what it should return and __write it's test first__ 

__NOTE:__ Uncomment the `tree_data` method at the end of your file and if your script has been crafted correctly, it should print some information about your tree and its fruit.

## Considerations
- What does `super` do?
- What's the difference between `attr_reader`, `attr_writer` or `attr_accessor`?
- How does inheritance work?
- How might you test your classes?
